# Green Algo
The service for algorithm visualization.

## Who?
The customers are:  
1) the ones who want to share an algorithm
2) the ones who want to know how to do sth

## Why?
Because How-To-Do sites use plain text to describe algorithm.
If an algorithm has branches this approach is too complicated for readers.
The visual algorithm is faster to read then one written in plain text.
